<h1>Fill-in <tt>FindDuplicateCount.java</tt></h1>
<p>
Given the integer array (arr) declared in the program. Count all the numbers that are repeated
in the array entries. If there are no duplicates then you should print out according to the
expected output. If there is only one duplicate then the message should state that. Finally for
two or more duplicates then the output should match the expected output. Your solution
should use loops (hint: double nested loops) and should work for any integer array.
</p>

<h2>Expected Output</h2>

<pre>
No duplicates with value 1 beyond Index 0
There are 3 more occurrences of value 2 starting at index 1
There are 2 more occurrences of value 2 starting at index 2
There are 2 more occurrences of value 3 starting at index 3
There is only 1 more occurrence of value 4 starting at index 4
There is only 1 more occurrence of value 2 starting at index 5
No duplicates with value 4 beyond Index 6
There is only 1 more occurrence of value 3 starting at index 7
No duplicates with value 0 beyond Index 8
No duplicates with value 5 beyond Index 9
No duplicates with value 3 beyond Index 10
No duplicates with value 2 beyond Index 11
