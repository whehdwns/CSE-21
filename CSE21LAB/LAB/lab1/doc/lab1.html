            CSE21 : Lab#1 - Knowledge Check
        </div>

        <h1> Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to CSE21! This lab is meant to be hard and to test your knowledge from
            CSE20. Perhaps it has been awhile since you took it or what you retained is shaky.
            This lab should not take the full three hours but if it does then you need to start
            studying. CSE21 is going to be decidedly harder than CSE20 and we expect you to
            have certain level of competence with the material covered already. Take this lab
            as the barometer of the comfort level we are expecting incoming students for this
            class. We encourage the students to work together so feel free to do that in lab
            sessions or outside. You should list the people you helped, helped you or just
            worked together.
        </p>

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            After starting Eclipse, create a new project called Lab 21_1.
            Import FindDuplicateCount.java
            from the assignment page (right click the
            file and save as into the project directory).
        </p>

        <h1><a href="remainderFunc.html">(Exercise 1) Create <tt>RemainderFunc.java</tt></a></h1>

        <h1><a href="findDuplicateCount.html">(Exercise 2) Fill-in <tt>FindDuplicateCount.java</tt></a></h1>

        <h1>(Assessment) Logic Check</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>
                When did you take CSE20?
            </li>
            <li>
                How long did this lab take to finish?
            </li>

            <li>
                Any difficult topics for you in these two exercises? If so list them:
            </li>
            <li>
                For the array given in <tt>FindDuplicateCount.java</tt>,
                which index is the last check we need to
                make to count all the duplicates?
            </li>
            <li>
                Interpret the number 101010 in bases 2, 10, 16.
                For each, convert to the other two bases (for example,
                when interpreting as base 2, convert to bases 10 and 16; when
                interpreting as base 10, convert to bases 2 and 16; etc).
            </li>
