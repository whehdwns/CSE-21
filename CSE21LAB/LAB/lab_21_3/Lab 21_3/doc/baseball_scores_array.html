        <h1> Baseball score processing, part 2 (Using Arrays) </h1>
        <h3> Problem </h3>
        <p>
            Add code to the program to print the box score of a completed game like a normal Boxscore.
            The first line of output will contain the runs scored in each inning
            by the visiting team, and the second line will contain the runs scored
            in each inning by the home team. The number of characters in each line
            should be the same, except that the box score of a game where the home team is winning
            at the start of the second half of the ninth inning should have nine characters
            in the first line and eight characters in the second.
            Assume that no more than nine runs are scored in any inning, and that the game
            ends after at most twenty innings.
            Do not include any blank characters in the output.
        </p>

        <h2>Task 1: <tt>initialize</tt></h2>
		<p> Fill-in the body of <tt>initialize</tt> method and answer the Assessment questions below. You may find that 
		answering the questions first or during this step is really useful in figuring out how to write initialize correctly.</p>

            <li>
                What does <tt>final</tt> mean in the declaration of MAX_BOX_SCORE_LENGTH?
            </li>
            
            <li>
   				What would happen if you try to change the value of MAX_BOX_SCORE_LENGTH inside <tt>initialize</tt>?         
            </li>
            <li>
   				What would be the value of the array entries if you did not initialize each entry to SENTINEL?         
            </li>
            <li>
   				How would uninitialized array differ from a game of MAX_BOX_SCORE_LENGTH (or 20) innings?
            </li>
             <li>
   				Given your above answers, what are possible values for SENTINEL if the score in each half inning is guaranteed to be <= 9?
            </li>
        <h2>Task 2: <tt>readScores</tt></h2>
	
            <p>
                Add code to <tt>readScores</tt> to fill in the arrays for visitor and home teams in appropriate entry. This should be very similar
                to your solution for lab 2, except that instead of one variable holding the current score, it saves every single entry. 
            </p>
            
            <li>
   				Show the lines you modified in this lab compared to Lab 2 inside <tt>readScores</tt>.
            </li>

		<h2>Task 3: <tt>gameScore</tt></h2>            
            <p>
            	We have provided <tt>gameScore</tt> method for you that takes an array and calculate the total of all the values in the array. 
            	It is smart enough to skips over SENTINEL values for each of the entries. In this step, you should analyze the code provided 
            	and answer the Assessment questions below. 
            </p>
            
            <li>
   				Explain how <tt>for (int v : teamBoxScore)</tt> line work by going through the array (i.e. what is v?)
            </li>
            <li>
   				How can the parameter <tt>teamBoxScore</tt> be used for both visitorScores and homeScores arrays?
            </li>
            <li>
   				If the array is MAX_BOX_SCORE_LENGTH, how many iterations would this for-loop go through?
            </li>
            <p>
   				<b>Modify</b> the body of the loop so the iterations match the innings played instead of going through 
   				the whole array every single time, regardless of the actual innings. (Hint: think about what 
   				it means to have the SENTINEL value in the entry)
            </p>

		<h2>Task 4: <tt>printBoxScore</tt></h2>
            <p>
                Fill-in <tt>printBoxScore</tt>,
                so that it prints the box score correctly.
                Assume that no more than nine runs are scored in any inning.
                Don't print any blank characters.
            </p>
            <li>
   				Are there any similarities in your implementation of <tt>printBoxScore</tt> to <tt>gameScore</tt>? 
            </li>
            <li>
            	How do they differ?
            </li>

		<h2>Task 5: <tt>result</tt></h2>
            <p>
                Add calls to the <tt>printBoxScore</tt>
                method in <tt>result</tt> in the proper place for both Visitor and Home team so it matches the expected output. 
                Also put in appropriate print statements so the output shows which line belongs to the visitor versus home teams. 
            </p>
            <li>
   				What is the effective minimum number of calls to <tt>gameScore</tt> in <tt>result</tt>?
            </li>
            <li>
   				What is the effective maximum number of calls to <tt>gameScore</tt> in <tt>result</tt>?
            </li>
            <p>
                <b>Minimize</b> the number of times <tt>gameScore</tt> is being called in <tt>result</tt> by modifying the code. Hint: Use variables
            </p>
            
        <h2>Task 6: <tt>gameIsOver</tt></h2>
            <p> We have provided <tt>gameIsOver</tt> method which works with the arrays. </p>
            <li>
   				What is the effective minimum number of calls to <tt>gameScore</tt> in <tt>gameIsOver</tt>?
            </li>
            <li>
   				What is the effective maximum number of calls to <tt>gameScore</tt> in <tt>gameIsOver</tt>?
            </li>

            <p>
            <b>Minimize</b> the number of times <tt>gameScore</tt> is being called in <tt>gameIsOver</tt> by modifying the code. Hint: Use variables
            </p>
