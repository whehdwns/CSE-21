            CSE21 : Lab#3 - Methods with Arrays
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        	We will use methods to solve the same baseball problem as Lab 2. In this version, arrays are used 
        	in the parameters as an easy way to pass a lot of information around. For baseball, it will be each 
        	innings score for both visitor and home teams. This will allow more sophisticated output formatting, 
        	more similar to the actual Boxscore you will see for baseball games.
