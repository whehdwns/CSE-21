        <h1> Baseball score processing, part 3 (Testing & Overloading) </h1>
        <h3> Problem </h3>
        <p>
        	We have two different ways to summarize the outcome of a baseball game. First is just 
        	a statement of who won and in how many innings. Second way is more detailed with the scores for 
        	each half innings. We will now add the capability for the users to choose which type of output they want to see.
        	Both of these behavior belongs to <tt>result</tt> so how can we make multiple version of it? Overloading is 
        	an easy to enable putting different behaviors inside the same method name but with different signatures. 
        	
        	We will tweak our method design so we are no longer reliant on class variables to hold all the information. We will move the 
        	declaration inside each of the methods and pass the information around instead. This makes the solution a little more complicated
        	but it allows for testing each individual methods. Unit tests for this lab are made for you already in ScorerComboTest.java.
        </p>

        <ol>
        <h2>Task 1: <tt>initialize</tt></h2>
		<p> Fill-in the body of <tt>initialize</tt> method and answer the Assessment questions below. Note that its job is reduced 
		now to just filling in the SENTINEL value for the two arrays that are passed in. It no longer knows anything about inning or batter 
		variables like in previous versions.</p>

            <li>
                visitorScores = new int [MAX_BOX_SCORE_LENGTH]; has been moved to <tt>main</tt>, why?
            </li>
            
            <li>
   				What would happen if visitorScores = new int [MAX_BOX_SCORE_LENGTH]; is inside <tt>initialize</tt>?         
            </li>
            <li>
   				Which scope or method does visitorScores array belong to now?
   			</li>
             <li>
   				What if the declaration of initialize changes to public static void initialize (int[] homeScores, int [] visitorScores )? Would it still work? (Explain how)
            </li>
            <li>
   				What about public static void initialize (int[] arr1, int [] arr2 ), would it still work? (Explain how)
            </li>
            <li>
   				What about public static void initialize (double[] arr3, double [] arr0 ), would it still work? (Explain how)
            </li>

        <h2>Task 2: <tt>readScores</tt></h2>
	
            <p>
                <tt>readScore</tt> now accepts three parameters (Scanner scores, int[] visitorScores, int[] homeScores). battle and inning are now local variable
                to <tt>readScore</tt>. They have been declared and initialized for you. Complete the code so it uses HOME and VISITORS constants correctly.
            </p>
            
            <li>
   				Show the lines you modified in this lab compared to Lab 3 inside <tt>readScores</tt>.
            </li>

		<h2>Task 3: <tt>gameScore</tt></h2>            
            <p>
            	We have provided <tt>gameScore</tt> method in ScorerCombo.java. In this step, you should start to look at ScorerComboTest.java 
            	and answer the Assessment questions below. 
            </p>
            
            <li>
   				How many tests are given in ScorerComboTest.java (for gameScore)?
            </li>
            <li>
   				Can you identify different type of testing that is missing for this method?
            </li>
            <p>
   				<b>Add</b> at least 3 tests into ScorerCombo.java for gameScore inside testGameScore.
            </p>
            
            <li>
   				List the 3 tests and why you added them here
            </li>

		<h2>Task 4: <tt>printBoxScore</tt></h2>
            <p>
                There are 3 different versions of <tt>printBoxScore</tt> given. Each of them have a different signature with the 
                parameter types. 
            </p>
            <li>
   				What is version 1 doing?
            </li>
            <li>
            	What is version 2 doing?
            </li>
            <li>
            	What is version 3 doing?
            </li>
            <li>
            	Which version is return printBoxScore(teamBoxScore); calling in version 3?
            </li>
            <li>
            	Where does the version 3 get the return value?
            </li>
		<h2>Task 5: <tt>result</tt></h2>
            <p> There are also 2 different versions of <tt>printBoxScore</tt>. It is your job to fill-in version 1. It is a simple version 
            of result where just based on the inning and the two scores, the proper output is returned. Version 2 is already implemented provided
            you did version 1 correctly. 
            </p>
            <li>
   				Version 2 has return result(inning, visitorScore, homeScore);, what is it doing?
            </li>
            <li>
   				Why do you not need batter inside result Version 1?
            </li>
            <p>
   				<b>Add</b> at least 3 tests into ScorerCombo.java for <tt>result</tt> inside testResult.
            </p>        
            <li>
   				List the 3 tests and why you added them here
            </li>
            
        <h2>Task 6: <tt>gameIsOver</tt></h2>
            <p> We have provided <tt>gameIsOver</tt> method which works with the arrays. 
            There is also testGameIsOver in ScorerComboTest.java. You need to add 3 additional tests to expand on what is being tested</p>
            <li>
   				How do you know what is being tested already in testGameIsOver?
            </li>
            <li>
   				List the 3 tests and why you added them here
            </li>
            
        <h2>Task 7: <tt>main</tt></h2>
            <p> Added the proper code inside <tt>main</tt> which will output just like lab 2 without the boxscore printed. </p>
            <li>
   				String answer = input.next(); is getting what type of answer from the user?
            </li>
            <li>
   				We need to check whether the answer is yes or no so we provided this code : 
   				if (answer.charAt(0) == 'y' || answer.charAt(0) == 'Y')
   				Why should we check against two different y's? 
            </li>
 
        </ol>
