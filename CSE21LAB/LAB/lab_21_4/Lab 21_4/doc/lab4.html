            CSE21 : Lab#4 - Methods with local variables and parameters 
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        	We will continue to solve the same problem and by now you should be really familiar with baseball scoring. 
        	The idea this week is to isolate the behavior of each method so it is easier to test them individually. 
        	For this, we will utilize the JUnits for unit testing. You will refactor your old solutions into the new methods. 
        	We will also add overloading of methods so different ones can be called allowing for customization within the same code base.

            You should have a Java project in Eclipse titled <tt>Lab 21_4</tt>.  This html
            page (that you are reading) is included in the project in the <tt>doc</tt> directory, in the
            file <tt>lab4.html</tt>.  The Java files you will use in this
            lab are in the <tt>src</tt> directory, as usual.
            
            If you need to add Junits into your project, then right click on it and open properties.
            Go to "Java Build Path", then Libraries tab. Click on "Add Library" and select JUnit then press Next>.
            Select Junit 4 and click Finish.
