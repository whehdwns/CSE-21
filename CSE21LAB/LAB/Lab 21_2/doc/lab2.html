            CSE21 : Lab#2 - Introduction to Methods
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This is the first time we will use methods to solve the problems. Methods are convenient 
            way to encapsulate behavior that we want to use multiple times. So they can be called (invoked) 
            anytime that is needed which is usually by another method. In fact, you have been using methods
            since CSE 20 because <tt>main</tt> is the starting point of our programs and a method itself. 
            It is <tt>main</tt>'s responsibility to call the correct method in the right sequence to get things started.
            It is important for you to do the reading first and understand how methods work before you attempt to do this lab.

        <h2>Getting Started </h2>
        <p>
        	Instructions are repeated here from your assignment page in case you unzipped the lab_21_2.zip file first 
        	and opened up lab2.html first. You can skip this section if you have properly followed the import instructions already.<br><br>
        	
            We'll do things a bit differently starting this week by importing an existing eclipse project rather than 
            creating one from scratch. By importing an already created project, all of the files will already be present 
            including the directions in .html files.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Download the <a href="../lab_21_2.zip">project archive file</a>.
                Remember the location of this directory to use in step 4 to import the archive for Lab 21_2 project. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Start Eclipse, and select the <tt>File | Import...</tt>
                menu item.  A dialog titled "Import" should open.  (You
                can open this Eclipse dialog in many different ways).
            </li>
            <li>
                Select <tt>General | Existing Projects into Workspace</tt>.
                (Don't select <tt>Archive File</tt>!).  Click <tt>Next &gt;</tt>.
                A dialog titled "Import Projects" should open.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the radio button for <tt>Select archive file:</tt> at
                the uppser left.  Now, click <tt>Browse...</tt> to the right
                of the radio button and locate the <tt>lab_21_2.zip</tt> file
                that you saved earlier.
            </li>
            <li>
                Having selected the archive file, you should be back in the
                "Import Projects" dialog.  Check that you have the
                project "Lab 21_2" listed in the center box, and that
                it is selected via it's checkbox.  Click <tt>Finish</tt>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You should have a Java project in Eclipse titled <tt>Lab 21_2</tt>.  This html
            page (that you are reading) is included in the project in the <tt>doc</tt> directory, in the
            file <tt>lab2.html</tt>.  The Java files you will use in this
            lab are in the <tt>src</tt> directory, as usual.
