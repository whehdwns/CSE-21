        <h1> Baseball score processing </h1>
        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p>
            A game of baseball or softball is composed of <i>innings</i>.
            Each inning has two <i>halves</i>.
            In the first half of an inning, the visiting team gets a chance to score <i>runs</i>;
            in the second half, the home team takes its turn to try to score.
            The visiting team's total score is the sum of the number of runs in the first half
            of each inning; similarly, the home team's total score is the sum
            of the number of runs in the second half of each inning.
        </p>
        <p>
            A baseball game normally consists of nine innings.
            There are two exceptions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When the home team's score exceeds the visiting team's score after completing the first half
                of the ninth inning, the game ends immediately with 8&frac12; innings;
            </li>
            <li>
                When at least nine innings have been played and the score is tied, the game goes into
                <i>extra innings</i>. Another inning is played;
                if the score is still tied, another inning is played, and so on.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Problem </h3>
        <p>
            <a href="../src/Scorer.java">Scorer.java</a>, already in your imported project,
            is a framework for a program to read half-inning scores from a baseball game
            and print the total number of runs scored by each team as well as information
            about which team won.
        </p>
        <p>
            This code uses Java <i>methods</i>
            to perform different sub-problems.  The comments for each method are intended
            to help you understand what each sub-problem is and how the method is
            supposed to solve it.  Included in the comments are descriptions of
            your tasks in this exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are to complete the framework and make the code work.  You'll change
            each of the methods in <tt>Scorer.java</tt>.
        </p>

        <h3>Sample Outputs</h3>
        <pre>
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0
The home team won 2 to 1 in 9 innings.
			
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 2
The home team won 3 to 1 in 9 innings.

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 2
The visiting team won 3 to 2 in 9 innings.
			
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 1
The home team won 6 to 5 in 11 innings.
			
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 1 0
The visiting team won 6 to 5 in 11 innings.
        </pre>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Complete the body of the <tt>initialize</tt> method
                by assigning values that represent the start of a game to
                the static instance variables.
            </li>

            <li>
                Rewrite the <tt>gameIsOver</tt> method so it doesn't use the
                "and" (&amp;&amp;) and "or" (||)
                operators.  Note: In assessment question #3, you will fill out
                a table of values that can help you test this method, so do that first to figure out the logic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Supply the body of the loop in the <tt>readScores</tt>
                method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill in the blanks in the <tt>result</tt> method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, supply the body of the <tt>main</tt> method to run the program correctly.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            For each method/task other than the last, you should test your solution from within 
            the main method.
            A sample test has been included for the <tt>initialize()</tt> task; it prints out
            the values of the relevant variables after <tt>initialize()</tt> has been called.
            When you are satisfied that you've tested the task enough and it works <i>perfectly</i>,
            comment out your testing code but <u>leave it in the main() method</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using temporary <tt>System.out.println()</tt> calls to test the functioning of methods
            that you are writing is a good way to inspect whether your solution is correct.  There are
            other ways&mdash;more complicated, but better for many reasons&mdash;that we will
            look at later in the course.
